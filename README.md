# dem-primary-2020

This is a continually updating repository with the latest results of the INSIDER poll conducted on SurveyMonkey Audience in order to fuel our conditional preference forecast.

Basically, we ask lots of Americans a few basic things on SurveyMonkey Audience. 

- We ask them if they're registered to vote.
- We ask them if they think they'll probably participate in their state's presidential primary/caucus and if so, which one. 
- We ask them, from a list of Democratic primary contenders, which they are familiar with.
- Once we know that, we ask them which of those contenders they would be satisfied with as nominee. Then we ask which they'd be unsatisfied with. For our purposes, we're only really interested in the answers to these questions from registered voters who say they'll probably vote in the Democratic primary, but everyone's asked it either way. 
- Sometimes, we ask everyone which of those candidates they think would probably beat President Trump in a general election, and which of those candidates they think would probably lose to the president. We're interested in everyone's answer here.

We run this question package periodically. The CSV files above contain the responses to those pieces. Here's additional descriptive statistics for each package. Candidates were dropped off as they exited the race.
