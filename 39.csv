He's NOT perfect but he's a HECK of a better choice then the Socialist's that want to turn our GREAT country into another Venezuela!!",I don't like the fact that he gets on Twitter so much and goes into a tirade. He should be more Presidential and sometimes when he speaks it's like he's speaking to a bunch of 3rd graders and repeats himself a little too much.,There is not ONE thing that I like about this man!
